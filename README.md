# compilerAssignment2

This is an implementation of a LALR(1) parser in C++.

The LALR(1) parse table has been pre-calculated and parser_table.txt contains the action part and goto.txt contains the goto part of the table.

The grammar is located in the grammar.txt file.

Input has to be given in the input.txt file and output is generated in the output.txt file.

Run the parser.cpp file to generate the output.

If the given input can be generated by the grammar given in the grammar.txt file, then derivation of the input string will be printed in the output.txt file,
otherwise it will show that an error has occured while parsing.

NOTE: All files should be in the same directory while running parser.cpp file.
